Project Overview
This repository contains four key tasks developed during my internship at Codetech IT Solutions. These projects demonstrate the application of modern Deep Learning and NLP techniques using Python.

Task 1: Text Summarization Tool
Description: An AI-powered tool that summarizes lengthy articles into concise paragraphs using the BART model.

Key Features: Context-aware summarization, user-interactive terminal interface, and error handling for short text.

Technology: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch.

Task 2: Speech Recognition System
Description: A system capable of transcribing short audio clips (WAV format) into text.

Key Features: Uses Google Web Speech API for high-accuracy transcription.

Technology: SpeechRecognition, PyAudio.

Task 3: Neural Style Transfer (NST)
Description: An artistic tool that applies the "style" of a famous painting to any content photograph.

Key Features: Uses a pre-trained CNN (Magenta model) for fast, high-quality stylization.

Technology: TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, Matplotlib.

Task 4: Generative Text Model
Description: A GPT-based model that generates coherent, human-like paragraphs based on a user-provided prompt.

Key Features: Adjustable creativity via temperature sampling and interactive prompt loop.

Technology: GPT-2, Transformers library.
